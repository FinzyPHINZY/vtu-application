### **Updated Plan for the BOLD DATA backend Development**

---

### **Phase 1: User Management Revamp**

1. **OTP-Based Sign-In**

   - Backend:
     - Build an API endpoint to send OTP to the user's email.
     - Create an endpoint to verify OTP and return a session or authentication token upon success.

2. **Complete Signup**

   - Backend:
     - After OTP verification, provide an API endpoint for completing user signup.
     - Store user details: name, pre-populated email, and phone number.

3. **Session Management**
   - Ensure the user session is persisted for subsequent actions (e.g., token-based authentication).

---

### **Phase 2: Bank Account Integration**

1. **Virtual Account Creation**

   - Automatically create a virtual account for each user upon successful signup using Safe Haven's API.
   - Store the virtual account details (account number, bank name) in the user’s profile.

2. **Depositing Money**

   - Integrate Safe Haven’s API to enable users to deposit funds into their virtual accounts.
   - Use webhooks or polling to confirm deposits and update the user’s balance in real time.

3. **Withdrawing Money**

   - Add functionality to transfer funds from the virtual account to any bank account.
   - Validate user input and ensure sufficient balances before processing transactions.

4. **Frontend Implementation**

   - Provide an interface to:
     - View account balance.
     - Deposit money (with details on how to fund the virtual account).
     - Transfer money (with recipient details and amount).

5. **Backend Security**
   - Enforce strong validations for transactions.
   - Record all transactions (deposits, withdrawals) in the database for auditing and user history.

### **Phase 3: Feature Implementation**

#### **1. Airtime Purchase (Priority Feature)**

- **Frontend:**
  - Create a form for selecting the network, entering the phone number, and specifying the amount.
  - Display a confirmation dialog before purchase.
- **Backend:**
  - Deduct the amount from the user’s virtual account.
  - Call Safe Haven's VAS transaction API to process the airtime purchase.
  - Record the transaction in the database.

#### **2. Cable TV Subscription**

- Follow the same pattern as airtime purchase:
  - Create an interface for users to select the provider, account number, and subscription package.
  - Deduct funds and call the respective API.

#### **3. Internet Data Purchase**

- Allow users to select the network, enter a phone number, and choose a data package.
- Integrate the appropriate API for processing the purchase.

#### **4. Electricity Bill Payment**

- Let users input their meter number and select the payment amount.
- Integrate Safe Haven’s API to process the bill payment.

### **Phase 4: Notifications**

- Use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for real-time notifications on successful transactions, deposits, and withdrawals.
- Send email notifications for transaction receipts.

---

### **Phase 5: Admin Panel**

- Monitor user activity, balances, and transactions.
- Analyze trends (e.g., total airtime purchases or deposits over time).
- Provide tools for debugging and managing user accounts.

---

### **Key Reasons for This Sequence**

1. **User Management Revamp First:** A seamless authentication system is the foundation for all subsequent features.
2. **Bank Account Second:** This feature is crucial for enabling purchases and transactions.
3. **Other Features:** Once the foundation is ready, these features can be built incrementally without dependency issues.
